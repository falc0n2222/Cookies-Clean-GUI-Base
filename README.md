# Clean Winforms GUI Base

## Outdated project that is no longer being maintained by both parties. Check the original fork for the most up to date version if you want to use this (although my recommendation is to NOT as this is riddled with bugs and is extremely prone to decompilation alongside RE'ing). I might do a rework of some of the code (including the addition of an actual license check) as this is a part of the first few projects that I worked on back when I first started tinkering with WinForms & getting into C#.

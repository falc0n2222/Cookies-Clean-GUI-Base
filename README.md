# Clean Winforms GUI Base

## Outdated project that is no longer being maintained by both parties. Check the original fork for the most up to date version if you want but my recommendation is to NOT use this as it is riddled with bugs and extremely prone to decompilation. I might do a rework of some of the code (including the addition of an actual license check) as this was a part of the first few projects that I worked on back when I first started tinkering with WinForms & getting into C#.

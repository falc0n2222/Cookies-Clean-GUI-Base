# Clean Winforms GUI Base

## Outdated project that is no longer being maintained by both parties. Check the original fork for the most up to date version & do NOT use this one as it is riddled with bugs and extremely prone to decompilation. I might do a rework of some of the code (including the addition of an actual license check) as this was a part of the first few projects that I worked on back when I first started tinkering with WinForms & getting into C#.
